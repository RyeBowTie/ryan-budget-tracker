# Description 

A budget tracking PWA that can work offline.

# Walk-Through

1. When a user navigates to the page they are presented with their total, a table of past transactions, and a graph showing the changes in total.

2. In addition both the static files and data collected are cached.

3. When a user goes offline they are still able to enter new transactions. These are stored in indexedDb.
